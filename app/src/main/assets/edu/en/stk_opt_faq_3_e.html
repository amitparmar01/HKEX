                     <p>Not very often. Options holders may only obtain the option's intrinsic value as their profits if they choose to exercise the option contracts. It is usually more profitable to sell the contracts in the market. Therefore only a small percentage of options contracts will be exercised.

                            <li>It is usually unwise to exercise an option early as the time value of the option will be sacrificed. When an option is deep in-the-money, however, only a very small amount of time value will be left. Investors may therefore wish to exercise the option early.</li>
                            <li>Another reason for early exercise is when investors want to receive the dividend entitled to the underlying stock. In this case, the investor will exercise his call option before the ex-dividend date</li>

                      <div class="detail">
                      <p>Not necessarily. Currently, open options contracts that are 1.5% or more in-the-money upon expiration will be automatically exercised if there are no prior overriding instructions from the broker. Investors are therefore advised to understand properly the Options Trading Exchange Participants policy and procedures on exercise of options contracts to ensure that their positions are properly handled.</p>

                     <div class="detail"><p>Stock options traded on SEHK are American style. Option writers therefore need to be prepared for assignment at any time, including on the same day the option is written.  An option position which is exercised or assigned will require the parties to deliver or pay for the underlying stock within the required stock settlement period (the second business day after exercise). <br><br>
                     At HKEX, the exercise of stock options results in the physical delivery of stock in contrast to other types of options exercise, which result in cash settlement. <br><br>
                     In some situations, most stock option positions may either be closed out before expiry or expire unexercised. At other times, exercising an option may be a sensible course for option holders. Option holders and writers therefore need to be sure they are familiar with the process.<br><br>
                     A stock option holder must instruct his or her broker to exercise the option if he or she wants it exercised. The brokerage firm has a deadline to meet every day after which SEOCH will not accept exercise instructions so the broker is likely to impose an earlier deadline on clients. Although SEOCH has a facility whereby certain deep in-the money options are automatically exercised upon expiry, brokers are able to over-ride this feature. It is therefore important for investors to inform their brokers if they wish to exercise.<br><br>
                     When an option is exercised, SEOCH selects, or assigns, on a random basis, the short open position against which it is exercised. If the accounts of an Exchange Participant’s clients are assigned, the Exchange Participant must in turn assign, on a random basis, a short open position of the client. The designated client is then required to deliver (in the case of a call option writer) or buy the underlying stock (in the case of a put option writer). Stock transactions resulting from the exercise of options are cleared under the Continuous Net Settlement System of Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company Limited, or HKSCC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of HKEX. This arrangement not only smoothens the settlement process, but also strengthens cross-market risk management by combining all the stock settlement positions resulting from the exercise of options and transactions from the stock market into the same portfolio for risk management purposes.

                     <div class="detail">
                       <p>All stock option contracts traded on SEHK are cleared through SEOCH, a central clearing house and a wholly owned subsidiary of HKEX. By novation, SEOCH acts as a counterparty to its Participants in relation to each option contract traded on SEHK and manages counterparty risk by, amongst other things, requiring margin funds from its Participants. SEOCH may also impose limits on the size and types of positions its Participants may keep. SEOCH is solely engaged in the business of managing risk and contract performance.<br><br>
                       SEOCH's role as counterparty only extends to its Participants.  It does not extend to its Participants’ clients or other counterparties. If an Options Trading Exchange Participant or Options Broker Exchange Participant defaults on any of its obligations to its clients, the client’s only recourse is to the Options Trading Exchange Participant or Options Broker Exchange Participant itself.  Not all Options Trading Exchange Participants are Participants of SEOCH. Only an Options Trading Exchange Participant which meets certain financial and operating requirements can become a SEOCH Participant.

On option expiry day, the latest price of the underlying stock before suspension will be used as option settlement price if the stock is still suspended for trading. Options holders can still exercise their options, but settlement of stocks can only be performed after the stock has resumed trading.</p>
