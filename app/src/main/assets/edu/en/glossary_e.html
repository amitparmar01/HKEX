                                       For example, a call option with a delta of 0.6 (or 60%) means that for every $1 the underlying stock increases, the call option value will approximately increase by $0.60, assuming other factors being constant. <br><br>
                                       Delta of put option is negative, however. A put option with a delta of -0.6 (or -60%) will approximately increase by $0.60 for every $1 the underlying decreases in price, assuming other factors being constant. <br><br>
                                       An in-the-money call (put) option nears expiration will have a delta very close to 1.00 (-1.00). <br><br>
                                       Please note that delta changes as other factors like option price, stock price, implied volatility, and time etc change.</p>

                     For out-of-the money options or options which are close to expiry, the effective gearing will be higher. <br><br>

                     <p class="detail">Gamma is the rate of change of Delta. Delta shows how much an option price will change for a one-point move of the underlying. However Delta is not constant and will increase or decrease at different rates. Gamma is the rate that delta will change based on 1% change in the stock price. 
Think of delta is the speed at which option prices change. Gamma is then the acceleration of the option prices changes. <br><br>
Gamma is the highest when the option is at-the-money. As option expiry day draws nearer, the gamma of at-the-money options increases while the gamma of in-the-money and 
out-of-the-money options decreases. <br><br>
Gamma is the same for call or put with the same strike and same expiry. Gamma is positive for longing a call or a put. Gamma is negative for shorting a call or a put.</p>

If the gearing of an option is 5 times, then the investment cost of such option is 1/5 of the underlying stock. Note that gearing only shows the relationship between investment cost of the underlying stock and the option. It
does not reflect the price movement relationship between the option and the underlying stock. Please refer to effective gearing for such relationship.</p>

This represents the total exposure from individual Participants to the clearing house. NOI, which eliminates the gross effect, provides an alternative angle for analysis.

Theta shows how much of time value is eroding for every day that passes, assuming all other factors being constant. Theta will always be a negative number since its impact on option price is always negative.<br><br>
                     For example, if a call option has a theoretical price of 1.80 with a theta (daily) of -0.02.
