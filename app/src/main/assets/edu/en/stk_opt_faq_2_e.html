                       <p>No. As different from an open-outcry trading system in which you can see the market makers standing amongst the crowd in the pit, you will not be able to be aware of the existence of the market makers physically through an electronic trading system. Therefore it does not mean that there is no interest in the market, nor you cannot trade in the market. You can always instruct your broker to input a quote request for the option series that you intend to trade into HKATS (Hong Kong Futures Automated Trading System). Market makers will offer two-way quotes in response to a quote request. You can then decide whether to enter your trade order. Alternatively, you may ask your broker to place your own limit orders into HKATS and wait for possible order matching in the market.</p>

                       <p>The stock options market operates separately from the stock market. The options client agreement describes trading and clearing arrangements such as payment of options premium and margin, stock delivery obligations as a result of exercise and assignment, and other options-related matters. The agreement includes a risk disclosure statement and a client information checklist. The former highlights the risks of options trading and helps to draw investors' attention to the high degree of risks associated with options trading while the latter helps the Options Trading Exchange Participant to assess the suitability of the client to trade options.</p>

                     <div class="detail">
                       <p>There is a margin requirement for all short option positions. After the close of trading each day, The SEHK Options Clearing House Limited (SEOCH), a subsidiary of HKEX, values all open positions with the settlement prices of each stock option series and assesses a margin requirement based on this valuation. This process is called marking to market. SEOCH collects this mark-to-market margin on a daily basis but may collect margin at other times as and when necessary. The mark-to-market margin represents SEOCH’s estimate of the cost of liquidating the open position at current market levels. <br><br>
                       In addition, in order to provide a buffer against any movements in the market that may have a negative effect on the value of an option before the next margin calculation, SEOCH also collects an additional amount, over and above the mark-to-market margin. This is called additional margin. SEOCH may accept as margin collateral cash, letters of credit, bank guarantees, securities, Exchange Fund Bills and Notes, etc as designated by the HKEX Board (and subject to change by the Board from time to time) and in such form as may be required by the Board. Investors should ask their brokers about the forms of collateral the brokers will accept.</p>

Therefore, there is no margin requirement for the option position, but margin may be required for the pending stock position after he has exercised the option.</p>
