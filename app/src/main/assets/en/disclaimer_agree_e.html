        <p><b>Risks of Trading Futures and Options</b><br />
        Futures and options involve a high degree of risk. Losses from futures and options trading can exceed your initial margin funds and you may be required to pay additional margin funds on short notice. Failure to do so may result in your position being liquidated and you being liable for any resulting deficit. You must therefore understand the risks of trading in futures and options and should assess whether they are right for you. You are encouraged to consult a broker or financial adviser on your suitability for futures and options trading in light of your financial position and investment objectives before trading.</p>
